## _v0.1.2 NOW AVAILABLE IN THE ANDROID MARKET & THE DOWNLOAD TAB ABOVE!_ ##


### **NEW VERSION:** ###
  * New Levels!!
  * Old Levels Updated / Bug Fixes

### **FEATURES:** ###
Putting a unique spin on the characters of Replica Island, TwoD\_mentia creates a whole new adventure to enjoy in the palm of your hands.

  * Your favorite control schemes are back! Jump, Fly, Squish!
  * Discover New Environments & New Enemies!
  * Submerse yourself in a dynamic battle of Shadow & Light!

### **STORY:** ###
TwoD\_mentia stars an unnamed shadow essence that resembles a ball shape, yet can morph itself to overcome various obstacles. Depicted in a world cast in darkness, the cliche roles are reversed in which you must defend the darkness as the forces of Light try to claim the world.
Infused with the powers of Light as a Shadow, it rests upon you to find the cause of these events and save your alliance. Don't worry though, you won't be alone! Shadowslime from Replica Island has taken you under (his? hers?)..it's.. guidance to show you the ways of being a shadow. Learn well from your fellow shadows, it might be the difference between death and survival.

For anyone interested, I have been documenting my development of this project since the beginning at my deviantART page: http://sikkpup.deviantart.com/

### **ISSUES / FEEDBACK:** ###
This is a trial / demo version. The game isn't complete, but I wanted to let people try out what I've got so far and add levels as I finish them.

Known Bugs:
  * There is an error where if you close the game during level select and use "Advanced Task Killer" the game will not start afterward.
_TO SOLVE_ go into your phones settings --> manage applications and **force close** the game, it should now open and run fine.
  * <s>If you go to Extras Menu and try to click Controls from the game will force close. I will look at fixing this in the next update</s>
_THIS ISSUE WAS RESOLVED IN **v0.1.1**_
